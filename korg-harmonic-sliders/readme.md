## harmonic sliders

Synthesize sounds with phyical controls to define the harmonic characteristics and attack, sustain, release enveloping.

running this is a little hairy:

 - connect a Korg MicroKONTROL to your computer
 - connect a midi keyboard
 - use an application like MidiPipe merge both devices' midi streams into a single device, mapping the MicroKONTROL's signals to channel 2.
 - maybe fix the hard-coded device settings to use that virtual device
